Viet Le, Fall 16
===

[00:00:00] 

[00:00:00] Viet: Get in like right away, without any introductions. [00:00:03] [00:00:06] [00:00:09] [00:00:12] [00:00:15] [00:00:18] [00:00:21] [00:00:24] [00:00:27] 

[00:00:27] Het: Alright. So yeah, you gotta be non-consensus [00:00:30] and Right. What's your most controversial opinion about the current AI [00:00:33] hype or the general VC landscape that you think is [00:00:36] correct, but most of your colleagues think is insane? 

[00:00:38] Viet: [00:00:39] Thing is that, I'm a pure early stage, [00:00:42] even a pre seed, seed investor. And [00:00:45] maybe that in itself is a little bit controversial, I'm not good with [00:00:48] ideas and theses. Because every time I have any [00:00:51] sort of thesis and I kind of write it down [00:00:54] then in a couple of months, a year, it turns out [00:00:57] to be entirely wrong.

[00:00:58] And so I realized for myself [00:01:00] that, It's more the founders that I'm [00:01:03] interested in. And I think that's the right thing to do. Because when I [00:01:06] entered the industry, like five and a half, six years ago. [00:01:09] Everybody was looking for the same type of founder.

[00:01:11] And [00:01:12] if there's something controversial how I [00:01:15] view the world is probably my founder taste, I actually [00:01:18] like the very young, very naive first time [00:01:21] founder type of people. 

[00:01:23] Where [00:01:24] people in investing or investors say this [00:01:27] archetype only appears or is only successful with [00:01:30] regards to consumer founders. But actually I think [00:01:33] I'm skewed towards that. 

[00:01:34] And [00:01:36] on the second, most of the companies that will [00:01:39] become big in the first wave in Gen [00:01:42] AI don't necessarily start as a pure Gen AI [00:01:45] company but look a little bit more boring and conventional. 

[00:01:47] Het: A [00:01:48] follow up question. Do you have any [00:01:51] preferences when it comes to like serial entrepreneurs versus like first time [00:01:54] founders?

[00:01:54] Viet: I don't necessarily think there's a right or wrong. I think [00:01:57] it's up to the investor preference. Of course, there are [00:02:00] investors that are very agnostic with regards to what types of [00:02:03] founders and what types of market they like but for me [00:02:06] as a pre seed, seed investor I think [00:02:09] You got you have to be founder led. I love to spend [00:02:12] time with the founders that are energetic, [00:02:15] very young and obsessed with, a couple of things in their lives.

[00:02:17] Alex: [00:02:18] So do you think there is an area where skill or [00:02:21] experience is an asset, or do you believe that it's generally just [00:02:24] better to have this naivety to start off 

[00:02:26] Viet: I think the y [00:02:27] intercept is important for sure, because then you have a different [00:02:30] starting point.

[00:02:30] But what's even more important is the slope. [00:02:33] I think the best types of founders are the ones that know how to [00:02:36] generate insights very fast and know how to incorporate [00:02:39] that insight into the product, and that [00:02:42] means that the Delta needs to [00:02:45] be very, very high in a given [00:02:48] period of time.


[00:02:48] Alex: You mentioned like being young, being energetic.[00:02:51] 

[00:02:51] Are there other things where you're like, you talk to the person for one time, then [00:02:54] you're like, I got to invest into this guy. 

[00:02:56] Viet: Where I always [00:02:57] go back to is like can the founders build or can the founders [00:03:00] sell?

[00:03:00] And pre seed, seed, probably there's [00:03:03] nothing outside of it really. You can measure how well [00:03:06] this can sell by how well can they [00:03:09] convince you from your vision, how well [00:03:12] can they convince customers .

[00:03:14] That's [00:03:15] all , selling and building, you can basically [00:03:18] see how fast they ship, how often they ship, what kind of [00:03:21] frequency the craft, craftsmanship


[00:03:22] Het: You were [00:03:24] originally a founder, but then pivoted to being a [00:03:27] VC.

[00:03:27] Can you give us a quick background on [00:03:30] yourself and why you did it? 

[00:03:31] Viet: Yeah, I think like [00:03:33] back the time when I founded the company together [00:03:36] with Florian Finke actually which eventually turned [00:03:39] out into Pina.

[00:03:40] It felt the [00:03:42] next best logical thing to do for me. [00:03:45] And I love creating stuff. I have a music [00:03:48] background. And then I had a [00:03:51] very visual background as a photographer and [00:03:54] then at some point producing videos

[00:03:55] so I inherently, I was [00:03:57] always, prone To start a company, so around the [00:04:00] time when I was in Berkeley and the idea of starting and founding [00:04:03] something together with Flo just felt right.

[00:04:05] I [00:04:06] love to play Champions League.

[00:04:06] I love to be good in something. [00:04:09] And I just like during the time when I was, [00:04:12] starting that company with Flo, I just like realized that [00:04:15] I'm not Champions League and being a founder, [00:04:18] I'm probably slightly better in [00:04:21] supporting those founders who Want to play Champions League.

[00:04:23] Het: Hmm. Yeah [00:04:24] But, so, you were a founder, [00:04:27] you said VC is your calling, but those are like [00:04:30] really different skill sets. How do you become a good [00:04:33] VC? And even furthermore, tell us about your entire process [00:04:36] of making independent decisions in a market that [00:04:39] is known for its FOMO?

[00:04:41] Viet: [00:04:42] Yeah, I think as an investor, you need to generate insights your own, 

[00:04:44] That [00:04:45] also means that when they, for example, have built something. And often [00:04:48] times they have a GitHub repo. Then, just like, [00:04:51] just do the homework and just open up. 

[00:04:52] Usually they [00:04:54] should provide something like you can play around with and [00:04:57] then you should build on top of it and I love building on top of things 

[00:04:59] [00:05:00] we invested into a company called Black Forest Labs in Freiburg, [00:05:03] behind the flux model, which is the essentially the [00:05:06] best image generation model out there. [00:05:09] Robin Rombach. Created and co authored Stable Diffusion [00:05:12] in 2022.

[00:05:12] And that essentially kicked off the Gen AI [00:05:15] era. And if you talk to [00:05:18] everybody in that field. Everybody was basically [00:05:21] referring to Robin's work, essentially. [00:05:24] And everybody saw Robin as the [00:05:27] benchmark as the number one researcher and Robin Rombach, [00:05:30] for example, probably is a completely different [00:05:33] type of founder than, let's say, [00:05:36] Hanno Renner from Personio, who's shining in a [00:05:39] completely different dimension. He's good at, [00:05:42] selling, convincing people.

[00:05:44] Het: Have you ever [00:05:45] met any exceptional founders, but in the wrong [00:05:48] market or building the wrong product? 

[00:05:49] Viet: Usually over [00:05:51] time, most of them should move into a market that [00:05:54] makes sense for everybody involved. So I [00:05:57] rarely see someone basically [00:06:00] stuck, and I think the context also matters, right? So [00:06:03] sometimes it's just like the wrong market during the [00:06:06] wrong time and then Some [00:06:09] external externality happens and then suddenly the right [00:06:12] market.

[00:06:12] So, for example when we invested into deal and deal [00:06:15] is like I don't know like a decacorn by now. [00:06:18] So I remember when we first talked to Alex Boazis. He [00:06:21] was building a solution for [00:06:24] freelancers essentially. And so you want to. Pay and [00:06:27] hire freelancers and you don't want to deal with the [00:06:30] paperwork.

[00:06:30] They took over the paperwork and they help you with all the [00:06:33] admin stuff with regards to hiring freelancers and [00:06:36] freelancers back in the day, it wasn't a particular large market but then [00:06:39] suddenly COVID happened and COVID [00:06:42] enabled that everybody was hiring from [00:06:45] everywhere.

[00:06:45] Deal was best positioned to serve that need and [00:06:48] the TAM suddenly grew [00:06:51] from freelancers to basically Hiring [00:06:54] globally

[00:06:54] and then it's not only like hiring and pairing, but [00:06:57] it's also kind of paying, managing them. And then you suddenly [00:07:00] become an HRS solution. That's unlocking a [00:07:03] completely different market. So I think like the best founders [00:07:06] usually move and [00:07:09] expand their potential market size.


[00:07:10] Het: Where does [00:07:12] defensibility come from in application layer AI [00:07:15] software? And how do you think about defensibility when [00:07:18] everyone is using like the same model, same APIs? 

[00:07:20] Viet: I [00:07:21] think you need, it's not a technology problem or [00:07:24] feasibility problem, and even worse for startups it will [00:07:27] get commoditized over time so I think the initial level [00:07:30] of defensibility is always, you provide better [00:07:33] experience or you build out the distribution.

[00:07:35] And so I [00:07:36] think all you can do in the beginning is just, like, build and sell. [00:07:39] And and have, for example, if, if [00:07:42] you're a better builder, have some sort of trick a [00:07:45] twist in the product. So, for example, what [00:07:48] gives Cursor. ai the right to win [00:07:51] against vS Code, they had the they put the chat [00:07:54] very present on the surface. You did [00:07:57] not necessarily manipulate the code directly, but you had a [00:08:00] validation step in between.

[00:08:01] You might even [00:08:03] have a white glove service component, I always call it [00:08:06] like some people it's just like a consulting business, but oftentimes, [00:08:09] especially in times of Gen AI, where the technology is [00:08:12] very nascent, people are not sure what kind of use [00:08:15] cases they'd like to get solved by this technology.[00:08:18] 

[00:08:18] Even there you need to be [00:08:21] more educational in your approach, more white glove, more [00:08:24] servicey. And that's a part of [00:08:27] being able to sell. One very good example is [00:08:30] Langdock in Berlin, a shout out to Lennard [00:08:33] and and his team.

[00:08:34] And, they started with a very [00:08:36] differentiated idea. It was very well [00:08:39] crafted but it didn't have the [00:08:42] distribution.

[00:08:43] Alex: So you, you figure out distribution first [00:08:45] and then you work backwards to the product?

[00:08:47] Viet: Both, like it's, [00:08:48] it goes hand in hand.

[00:08:49] It's not necessarily a sequence, [00:08:51] but I think Langdock over time just showed They're good in [00:08:54] both things. And I think both things are somewhat necessarily [00:08:57] necessary in order to create that defensibility over time. [00:09:00] Then once you have the distribution, that's great [00:09:03] defensibility.

[00:09:03] When you have the distribution to expand your [00:09:06] product in other product verticals, that's great defensibility [00:09:09] as well because like then you have the foot in the door. You [00:09:12] have users That use every aspect of [00:09:15] your application that [00:09:18] creates high stickiness.

[00:09:19] There's nothing else other than selling [00:09:21] well and building well. 

[00:09:23] Alex: So when [00:09:24] do you think that shift will happen from say, as kind of [00:09:27] reverting always to a simple chat interface to like [00:09:30] Being more open towards way crazier applications of [00:09:33] AI like having agents do stuff for you on the side Or [00:09:36] do you think it would be possible now?

[00:09:38] Viet: Yeah [00:09:39] when it comes to end to end agents We're not there [00:09:42] yet, but we might be

[00:09:43] When it comes to how much you [00:09:45] pay per intelligence, I think that will go down. [00:09:48] And, as a founder who builds long term, [00:09:51] you should have that in mind and incorporate that in mind. 

[00:09:53] And and that [00:09:54] might be a great way, actually, even though the agent probably [00:09:57] fails in step three, four, five right now. [00:10:00] If you're very smart about that fact, and you incorporate the [00:10:03] UX and query the user at the right time, and decrease [00:10:06] the the degree of how many [00:10:09] mistakes the agent will do.

[00:10:10] Then I think you can [00:10:12] build a distribution and over time just [00:10:15] Not pray or hope, but just be very confident that [00:10:18] models will become better over time. And when it comes to [00:10:21] end to end agents, like be very wary where currently the [00:10:24] limitations are or they will be solved in a couple of [00:10:27] months and, and years, and it's a great advantage if you can build out [00:10:30] distribution right now, you have to make sure that the [00:10:33] customers remain and that you do by being very, [00:10:36] smart in UX and querying the user at the [00:10:39] right spot at the right time.

[00:10:40] And that's why I, [00:10:42] I, I like bringing Cursor AI as an example because [00:10:45] they are very well positioned to be the end to end agent. Right [00:10:48] now, they are not. They are IDE, they have the chat [00:10:51] interface . But I'm pretty sure that they are very well positioned because [00:10:54] right now, with a couple of UX tricks, they built a [00:10:57] distribution.

[00:10:58] Everybody using them. Everybody's [00:11:00] loving them. Everybody is putting tons of [00:11:03] context, ,documents, code base, everything in it. [00:11:06] Boom. And in two years you have the [00:11:09] model. They have the users. They have the context. [00:11:12] And then for sure they will be able to solve the end to [00:11:15] end problem. I think you need to be smart about what your [00:11:18] entry is.

[00:11:19] Alex: So just kind of having [00:11:21] the right level of autonomy at the right time and just kind [00:11:24] of limiting. 

[00:11:24] Viet: Automate the stuff you can automate now for [00:11:27] sure. There are things you can automate and then the steps where you [00:11:30] need more context, just ask the user. The user is [00:11:33] there. They're not going to go away.

[00:11:35] Alex: That makes a lot of [00:11:36] sense. Because I feel like there's a lot of companies that should [00:11:39] focus on getting a lot more users first and just kind of [00:11:42] trying to build like a really fancy demo because I think like a lot of people [00:11:45] just get really scared when you do something and it's not [00:11:48] somewhat deterministic.

[00:11:49] Like you cannot be sure that it's going to [00:11:51] be, that it's going to happen as you intended. So just [00:11:54] limiting this, Uncertainty with AI, the [00:11:57] probability that something goes wrong in your user experience right [00:12:00] now, while still offering some viable [00:12:03] product. I think it's probably like what Cursor [00:12:06] specifically like figured out.

[00:12:07] Where do you think whole space of writing [00:12:09] code with AI will go? Do you think it's gonna be [00:12:12] completely automated away, how soon do you think that will happen?[00:12:15] 

[00:12:15] Viet: I mean, I think the best tools out there, they, [00:12:18] they, they probably give you the [00:12:21] right level of abstraction.

[00:12:22] Just look back into one of the [00:12:24] previous hottest categories that people [00:12:27] invested in and found it, which was no code. [00:12:30] And no code had a very similar [00:12:33] promise that. Hey, everybody is able to [00:12:36] build apps.

[00:12:36] But then, I mean, even though you [00:12:39] could, build very useful apps, it [00:12:42] seemed like most of those no code [00:12:45] tools, they converge to the same persona [00:12:48] again. So retool started off as a [00:12:51] great no code tool that's able to [00:12:54] integrate data sources like Postgres databases and gives [00:12:57] you different good representations on top of it, [00:13:00] everything in no code.

[00:13:00] So you can capture and [00:13:03] automate and build internal apps with it. [00:13:06] And You can automate ops heavy stuff, for example. The [00:13:09] big promise back in the day was focus on the non-developers, non [00:13:12] coders.

[00:13:12] And then over time they just like realized [00:13:15] that people love to find solutions to solve [00:13:18] their needs. Retool over time, they [00:13:21] just expanded more into the developer [00:13:24] persona by giving them more tools .

[00:13:26] So it [00:13:27] retool actually made the developer faster. [00:13:30] And it, it wasn't such a democratizing set of [00:13:33] toolings or a product. And so I think very similar [00:13:36] in the first wave, at least of AI I think it will [00:13:39] make the developer more productive. 

[00:13:41] That's [00:13:42] what I was referring to kind of like convergence of skill [00:13:45] set.

[00:13:45] Alex: So you have a substack and [00:13:48] you said that you believe that a lot of the value will accrue in [00:13:51] the application layer. What are some crazy areas where you think there [00:13:54] should be a crazy application level AI [00:13:57] company that's super successful? Do you have an intuition where that [00:14:00] might happen, or is it just not really [00:14:03] super clear yet?

[00:14:03] Viet: I mean, it's a question of time until we [00:14:06] see the big AI native [00:14:09] outcomes. Think in a first wave, first generation of [00:14:12] companies who will benefit most from AI are just very [00:14:15] conventional software startups that existed [00:14:18] before, and they slap AI on top of it. And so, [00:14:21] in general how I see it, and also [00:14:24] many other peers are, is that [00:14:27] AI is in the first generation [00:14:30] an enabling technology.

[00:14:31] And so [00:14:33] probably most of the value will be captured [00:14:36] by companies that have distribution out there.

[00:14:38] Het: Most of these [00:14:39] companies, though, offer AI as an extra feature to [00:14:42] their already established product set.

[00:14:43] What industries do you [00:14:45] think are going to be dominated by AI first [00:14:48] companies instead of companies that just add AI as an extra [00:14:51] feature? 

[00:14:51] Viet: Yeah, probably companies that I [00:14:54] always say like a double leapfrog, a double leapfrog [00:14:57] means in my opinion the case where you can basically not only [00:15:00] transform processes in a way [00:15:03] that you bring software or even cloud [00:15:06] to the world, but also put AI on top of it. [00:15:09] And so there are a lot of old industries, overlooked [00:15:12] industries that you cannot just like basically directly [00:15:15] crack with the promise of software, but you need a little bit [00:15:18] of hand holding. And it can be ranging [00:15:21] from payroll, for example To more [00:15:24] established industries in manufacturing and so on.



[00:15:25] Second leapfrog is just [00:15:27] build it in an AI native way. 

[00:15:28] And that's why, you probably see a [00:15:30] lot, with people trying to displace [00:15:33] the ERP market in different verticals, for [00:15:36] example. Because they see the chance to kind of like, you know, we're not only building [00:15:39] a better ERP, so leapfrog number one, but [00:15:42] leapfrog number two.

[00:15:43] We're going to just rethink it with [00:15:45] AI, and that's probably where if they're going to be [00:15:48] successful, that's probably where it's going to be very, [00:15:51] very interesting in the future. 

[00:15:52] Het: Maybe one more question, where do you see [00:15:54] the biggest opportunity in the [00:15:57] consumer space apart from what exists so far? [00:16:00] Because most tools exist for like programmers or [00:16:03] productivity

[00:16:04] Viet: I mean, Scott Belsky said [00:16:06] that People are lazy, vain, and [00:16:09] selfish. So I think if you want to [00:16:12] be a successful consumer founder you build [00:16:15] a product that serves these three things. I [00:16:18] think somewhere on Twitter I see a matrix of the [00:16:21] vices of a human and then there's an app attached to it 

[00:16:23] [00:16:24] The previous consumer generation you know, the [00:16:27] Facebook, Instagrams of this world, I think they [00:16:30] failed to deliver the promise of connecting the people. I feel [00:16:33] like people are a little bit more lonely and more isolated with their [00:16:36] devices. And maybe there's a lot of value in the consumer space [00:16:39] to solve that, solve the loneliness part, but at the [00:16:42] same time still incorporate the lazy, vain, [00:16:45] selfish principles or the vices of a human principles. 

[00:16:47] Alex: [00:16:48] Making a really big [00:16:51] segue here.

[00:16:51] We talked a lot that VC is a people [00:16:54] business. So what are some other non-obvious skills that [00:16:57] you think founders should have and what do you think that people [00:17:00] generally lack, that you would need to build [00:17:03] a really successful big company?

[00:17:05] Is there like [00:17:06] something that is really counterintuitive, not obvious in that [00:17:09] sense? 

[00:17:09] Viet: Oftentimes, it's just a lack of bias for [00:17:12] action. Not having the ability to generate those insights [00:17:15] fast. How do you get those insights fast? Just go out there, talk, [00:17:18] sell. Build, incorporate that feedback, build it in, [00:17:21] go out again. And that does not [00:17:24] necessarily mean that the MVP approach Like [00:17:27] boil everything down to a very tiny piece of [00:17:30] software No, but it just just like means that you [00:17:33] have the bias for action to go [00:17:36] out there achieve those [00:17:39] milestones And sell and build.

[00:17:40] So anytime I'm bored, I come up [00:17:42] with a new hypothesis on how the [00:17:45] world should look like and like read [00:17:48] cool blog posts by my peers and [00:17:51] then think that, okay, I need to somehow incorporate that [00:17:54] thinking. Months and years after, I just come back to [00:17:57] okay, let's focus on the founder Because that's just all you [00:18:00] have in the early stage and then [00:18:03] within the founder can they build, can they [00:18:06] sell?

[00:18:06] Alex: For sales a lot of people say sales is more like something [00:18:09] that you kind of have naturally or you don't have the skill [00:18:12] of convincing do you think it's more of an inherent [00:18:15] trait that you have as a person?

[00:18:16] Viet: It's not a distinct one, right?

[00:18:17] Like [00:18:18] If you're exceptional in building things, then it's [00:18:21] also automatic a little bit of selling already. And so [00:18:24] I wouldn't say like those two categories are entirely MECE. I [00:18:27] think, in order to build a big company, [00:18:30] there's no way around the selling part. Even though [00:18:33] some of the selling part can be the building stuff. [00:18:36] But then over time you probably need to take on some of [00:18:39] the skills. And setting can also mean you [00:18:42] convince and you sell your vision to people [00:18:45] that can sell your product and eventually that you can hire.

[00:18:47] [00:18:48] That's also part of selling. That's what I meant in the beginning. And [00:18:51] so in some way you need to kind of do the selling yourself, selling the product, [00:18:54] selling the vision. And then others could [00:18:57] complement the areas of selling where you're not good at. [00:19:00] Like, you know, actually selling into accounts, for example.[00:19:03] 

[00:19:03] But yeah, it's a combination of [00:19:06] those two things essentially. And in B2B, [00:19:09] Andre said it in another podcast, if you cannot convince [00:19:12] five people that the idea you [00:19:15] have can solve any of their problems, then is that really the idea?

[00:19:17] Alex: [00:19:18] Yeah. Super impressive. 

[00:19:20] Het: At [00:19:21] such an early stage, what do you think about [00:19:24] product led companies versus sales led [00:19:27] companies? 

[00:19:28] Viet: I think depends on the [00:19:30] market, what kind of company you want to build, what kind of [00:19:33] founder you are.

[00:19:34] And so [00:19:36] for some, it's more founder led sales game. For [00:19:39] some, it's more like a PLG game, then you lay out it on [00:19:42] top, but it doesn't take away the essence [00:19:45] of somehow selling it.

[00:19:46] So, for [00:19:48] example, are you, are you familiar with Supabase?

[00:19:49] Alex: Yes. 

[00:19:50] Viet: Great [00:19:51] company too. They closed their first customer onsite [00:19:54] next to them. So basically they drove to the customer, [00:19:57] and they wanted to convince them of a [00:20:00] hosted, a cloud based Postgres [00:20:03] database. And so they had to migrate one [00:20:06] database to the other.

[00:20:07] They just like drove there. [00:20:09] Set next to the customer and user and [00:20:12] just help them migrate the new database and set it [00:20:15] up. And if you hear about this, then some [00:20:18] would say it's not a scalable product. You [00:20:21] don't do this, blah, blah, blah.

[00:20:22] But I think that's necessary. I think [00:20:24] like it's somewhat like they could unlock how to [00:20:27] sell their product. couldn't sell by itself, so they sat next to [00:20:30] the user. And so these are the things needed. If their product [00:20:33] alone cannot sell, you need to sell.

[00:20:34] And if you cannot sell over [00:20:36] Zoom, then you need to be on site.

[00:20:38] Alex: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. [00:20:39] That's also kind of coming back to the previous point of you [00:20:42] having almost like a little consulting business at first because [00:20:45] you don't really have that much other stuff, right?

[00:20:47] Like you don't have a [00:20:48] fully fledged product that you can just automatically onboard [00:20:51] with. 

[00:20:51] Viet: Yes, ideally the product speak for itself and I [00:20:54] have great tons of respect for product that [00:20:57] Never needs any implementation effort but [00:21:00] sometimes it's just needed because when you just targeted [00:21:03] a type of persona that's not tech savvy, for example, [00:21:06] or somewhat the system and structures they've been [00:21:09] using is so complicated to break up [00:21:12] or, for example, the data sources lie in [00:21:15] different local spreadsheets here [00:21:18] databases there then yes charge [00:21:21] high enough so you can afford going on site. [00:21:24] Do the data integration. Once you have the data [00:21:27] integration, you might be able to slap a [00:21:30] Great crud app on top of it and then [00:21:33] solve lots of their problems.

[00:21:34] So yes I [00:21:36] think different methods of selling and distributing your product [00:21:39] for different markets, but in the end it's just like finding a way [00:21:42] how to do it either bottom up or top down.

[00:21:44] Alex: Are there any [00:21:45] companies that just completely autonomously grew their product [00:21:48] without any kind of intervention right from the get go [00:21:51] Especially I think in b2b, right? 

[00:21:53] Viet: That's why I'm [00:21:54] saying that there's not necessarily a pattern you think you need to [00:21:57] adapt the ways how you build and sell your product [00:22:00] depending on what types of users you encounter.

[00:22:02] You [00:22:03] know Palantir. You send in all those forward deployed [00:22:06] people. They integrate that stuff. They build the use cases on [00:22:09] top of it. But once you set it up, once you [00:22:12] educated the users in between, it might be the [00:22:15] software taking over at some point and capturing that value.

[00:22:17] And [00:22:18] so, yeah, for these types of companies, sometimes that's [00:22:21] needed. 

[00:22:21] Alex: So we actually asked, other people also [00:22:24] to kind of send us some questions for the podcast. And this one is from [00:22:27] Mark, from Langfuse. Is there like some super [00:22:30] fundamental advice, that you would love to share with CDTM [00:22:33] founding teams on things that they just do [00:22:36] fundamentally wrong in the aggregate?

[00:22:37] Viet: Oh, CDTM founders are great. [00:22:39] But sometimes I see too much of that whiteboard stuff and I [00:22:42] think most of the founders should be more naive and green and [00:22:45] go out there and just have a good set of assumptions and [00:22:48] build it.

[00:22:48] And I think that we lost a little bit over time. I'm not [00:22:51] sure why suddenly a lot [00:22:54] of Teams have the attitude of I need to do [00:22:57] a lot of the prerequisites and that involves [00:23:00] research like undirected, unopinionated , [00:23:03] not building coding anything. and don't go out there and [00:23:06] do the selling part.

[00:23:07] I think just have a unique [00:23:09] point of view how the world should operate. [00:23:12] Start with it, go out and try to sell it. If you build it and sell [00:23:15] it or just launch it somewhere. I think [00:23:18] that teaches you so much more than a whiteboard and [00:23:21] so I would say if I had an advice to all the cd tem [00:23:24] folks then ditch the whiteboard stuff entirely, [00:23:27] just find an area where you're most drawn to [00:23:30] and most interested by Pull up Langdock [00:23:33] AI for example or put up figma. I don't know pull up [00:23:36] retool. Put in some dummy data and then just [00:23:39] try to find out whether whatever you [00:23:42] build is useful or not 

[00:23:44] Alex: [00:23:45] Yeah, especially now like with AI, it's just so easy to [00:23:48] just get something out there.

[00:23:49] Viet: All the [00:23:51] MVP stuff and the Eric Ries stuff comes from a world [00:23:54] where building and coding actually was expensive. [00:23:57] And you know, it was a rare [00:24:00] resource. Maybe. I mean, if you're a [00:24:03] foundation model company, then it's a different game.

[00:24:05] But [00:24:06] for most of the companies and most of the [00:24:09] ideas that CDTEM has just build it, launch it. And [00:24:12] even if it means that you're creating a [00:24:15] very compelling video, then you get feedback on it. And [00:24:18] if you get feedback on it and people sign up, then it's great. You can [00:24:21] build it.

[00:24:21] Just do it, buys for action building and selling.

[00:24:23] Yeah, [00:24:24] yeah, that's really good advice. 

[00:24:26] Viet: Yeah, for some, [00:24:27] yes, you cannot do the very granular thing. [00:24:30] Of course, I think, with the advent of [00:24:33] AI, for example, for sure. I think the barrier of creating those [00:24:36] things decreased. And so also the barrier [00:24:39] of what is actually good also [00:24:42] increased because everybody is now able to kind of build the CRUD app

[00:24:44] But at the [00:24:45] same time, I think there's also a balance to how long are you going to [00:24:48] do the whiteboard, the framework, stuff, idea thing, [00:24:51] gate one, gate two, like who gives a fuck? The [00:24:54] real insights come from the market. 

[00:24:56] Alex: Yeah. But [00:24:57] that, that seems to be like a piece of advice that was [00:25:00] usually as you said, with the Eric Ries MVP a [00:25:03] little bit antiquated now in the age of AI.

[00:25:05] Do you think there are like [00:25:06] other like kind of common pieces of startup [00:25:09] advice that are outdated now?

[00:25:10] Viet: Might be a repetition because I already said [00:25:12] it. I think you need to have a unique view on [00:25:15] how the world should look like, because even [00:25:18] though many of the users have the problems, [00:25:21] They don't have the idea about the solution. So you can [00:25:24] be very opinionated, you can say , okay, I have a very unique view how [00:25:27] to solve that problem, just go out and build it.

[00:25:29] Because sometimes they [00:25:30] just ask and then, you know, yes, spend time with the [00:25:33] users to understand the problem. But I think some just take the excuse to kind [00:25:36] of like just do 1. 2x stuff that's [00:25:39] better. Because you're basically constrained in a fantasy and the [00:25:42] expectation of the user sometimes.

[00:25:43] And then maybe [00:25:45] one of the antiquated stuff out there is just , you know [00:25:48] ask all that. You don't need to ask all that shit. Just understand the problem [00:25:51] well. Have a very unique point of view how to solve it. [00:25:54] Great twist on the UX. And then just boom do it.

[00:25:56] Het: [00:25:57] Alright, we thought we could do this as a [00:26:00] rapid fire. You might know it from [00:26:03] 20BC. 

[00:26:03] What is your superpower?

[00:26:05] Viet: Maybe I can vibe [00:26:06] well with builders and technical founders. Yeah. [00:26:09] If there's one thing probably I'm good at, it's that.

[00:26:11] Het: [00:26:12] Do you think this is your life's work? 

[00:26:14] Viet: Yeah, [00:26:15] it is. Enabling young founders is my life's [00:26:18] work. 

[00:26:18] Het: What are you optimistic about, apart from [00:26:21] AI?

[00:26:22] Viet: Technology [00:26:24] in general, I think if you zoom out of our [00:26:27] bubble, then there's sometimes a [00:26:30] negative connotation around all things technology, all things [00:26:33] progress. And I'm just fully convinced [00:26:36] that there is a correlation, a [00:26:39] causation between technology and [00:26:42] welfare and for example 

[00:26:44] life 

[00:26:44] [00:26:45] expectancy. Yeah. And so I think all of that was [00:26:48] driven by technology. Technology drives the [00:26:51] economy, and the economy just enables that stuff

[00:26:53] Het: right. [00:26:54] Last question.

[00:26:54] What are you running from, and what are you running [00:26:57] towards? 

[00:26:57] Viet: Running from a stagnant [00:27:00] and static environment. And running towards [00:27:03] new stuff, new things, change.

[00:27:05] Het: [00:27:06] Nice. Well then, so much [00:27:09] for staying here for like two and a half hours.

[00:27:10] Alex: It was a really good [00:27:12] conversation.
